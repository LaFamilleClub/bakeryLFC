I found a link to this on LemmaSoft originally. The article was several months old. There was discussion about the future of it and the contents of the README.md, but the top level README.md contained nothing useful, and there was no README.md at this level.
What I do know:
1. There is also a Phone module, and it actually has licensing info. It's actually in LICENSE.md, not README.md, and it says "Copyright (c) 2025 Zoey (KleineLuka)". It is provided under MIT license. Therefore, I assume the File Explorer module is the same from it and the discussion in the LemmaSoft forum.
2. According to the forum, it wasn't completed. "i plan to share it when it's done and in a usable form," but there is no follow-up.
3. I'm not going to go get some sort of code or whatever to create an account on LemmaSoft, lol.
4. Since there wasn't a README.md, I had to bang my head on the desk to figure out how to use it.
5. I had to make some minor changes to actually get it to "Let players use their own images", the subject of the forum post.
6. I may want to make more changes because the wording of the controls is not quite standard, and it took me quite a while to figure out how it should work.
7. The original author can take advantage of any changes ... or not.

TBD:

How to install and call the File Explorer module.
User interaction with the module.
Document changes.

Changes:
Ren'Py expects rpy files, not py, so renamed file_explorer.py to file_explorer.rpy. BTW, VS Code has a plug-in for Ren'Py.
